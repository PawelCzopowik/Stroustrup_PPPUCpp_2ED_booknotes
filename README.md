# VS 2019 setup
1. Cloned repo
1. Created empty VS project in its root so the "solution" has a git repo integrated
1. added projects for each chapter (ch3, ch4, etc)
1. using .gitignore that was generated by VS when a new projet is created (and one from git?)


# New setup 12:56 PM 8/30/2020

The foler, solution, and project organization will be as follows:

The root folder will be a container for each solution.
Each solution will represent a chapter.
Each project will represent a single exercise or program.

# Vistual Studio project setup 
1. Create a solution as an **empty project** **Alt+f-n-p or Ctl+Shift+N
    1. Name it by chapter, ex: **ch12**
    1. Set location to: **C:\src\pc2550\Stroustrup_PPPUCpp_2ED\\**
    1. **Uncheck:** Place solution and project in the same directory
1. Add new project **Alt+f-d-n**
    1. Choose whatever is needed (Console App usually)
    1. Name it by exercise, drill, etc, ex: **ex3 drill5**
1. Don't forget to set a project as the startup **Alt+p-a**
1. Add exercise file **ch3exercises.md** in root solution **resource files** and copy problems from book
1. Copy the contentes of **template-new-exercise.cpp** to main source file.
1. In each project, add an existing file **Shift+Alt+A** and add **../../lib/std_lib_facilities.h** or any other headers you need.
1. Starting ch12? **Alt-P-P** In project properties > Linker > Input, add the following: **fltkd.lib; wsock32.lib; comctl32.lib; fltkjpegd.lib; fltkimagesd.lib**


# FLTK Setup
This is copied from the github-page of this repo (canon)

1. Download, extract
1. Open solution, C:\src\lib\fltk-1.3.5\ide\VisualC2010\fltk.sln
1. Build (should be no errors, 2 warnings)
1. Copy FL & GL folders to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\VS\include
1. Copy .lib files C:\src\lib\fltk-1.3.5\lib from to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\VS\lib\x86
1. Copy fluidd.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\Tools Not sure if this is necessary, maybe for cmd line
1. In project properties> Linker > Input, add the following: fltkd.lib; wsock32.lib; comctl32.lib; fltkjpegd.lib; fltkimagesd.lib

The VS paths above are already in the default search paths.
